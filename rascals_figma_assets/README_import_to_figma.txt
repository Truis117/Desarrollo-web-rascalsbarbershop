RascalsBarbershop â€” Figma import assets
--------------------------------------

Files included (desktop PNG mockups):
- home_desktop.png
- services_desktop.png
- booking_desktop.png
- gallery_desktop.png
- contact_desktop.png
- admin_desktop.png

How to import into Figma:
1. Open Figma and create a new file.
2. Drag & drop these PNG files into the canvas. Figma will create frames from images.
3. Use these images as base artboards. Trace with vector shapes, add text layers and components to convert to editable UI.
4. Suggested artboard size: 1440x1024 (already set in these PNGs).
5. For mobile versions, create new frames (e.g., 390x844) and either resize or create dedicated mobile mockups.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Produce mobile-sized mockups (390x844) for each page.
- Produce SVG or layered PDF exports for easier vector editing in Figma.
- Create a Figma-ready component library (buttons, form inputs, cards).
