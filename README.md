# Clip & Fade — Barbershop (static site)

Local preview:

Open `index.html` in your browser. For a local server (recommended):

Python 3 built-in server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000

What I added:
- `index.html` — semantic, accessible homepage markup (header, nav, main sections, form, footer).
- `styles.css` — mobile-first stylesheet with responsive grid and accessible focus states.
- `scripts.js` — small client-side validation and footer year helper.

Next improvements:
- Add real booking backend or integrate a scheduling service.
- Replace placeholder images and `logo.svg` with real assets.
- Add microdata or OpenGraph metadata for SEO and social sharing.
- Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation testing and screen reader checks.
